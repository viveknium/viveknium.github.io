    <p>Before I begin to bring in light the difference, let me make it clear that by no means I endeavour to defend populism by refusing to call it fascism. Lest you readers criminalize me as an apologist for the populists or as a believer in populism. But the point I want to make is that this distinction is extremely important, important to curb populism itself.</p>

    <p>Niall Ferguson, the world renowned historian, in one of his talks at Google said “The more Donald Trump is compared with Hitler, the more likely, paradoxically, he is to win because his supporters simply aren’t convinced by that analogy”.</p>

    <p>You the liberals, “the enlightened”, know that populism is not the answer to the problems which the world faces today. Populism points to the right problems but it dishonestly blame the wrong causes. Responsibly, you go to talk to your populist friend to try to convince him/her of the same. But you make an error in your opening sentence. You tell your friend that the leader he/she is going to vote for is a Fascist!</p>

    <p>“Fascism is about men in uniforms with armaments engaging in warfare. The central goal of the Nazi regime in 1930 was war. Its tool of economic recovery was re-armament. There is a fundamental difference.” Niall explained later in his talk. (For now let’s just forget RSS folks marching in Khaki uniforms)</p>

    <p>Your friend’s hero doesn’t do that. You lost on your quest to convince your friend. Your friend rightly recognizes that you are wrong. His leader doesn’t march in uniforms and is not calling for any military warfare. Opening a case with a wrong analogy is neither a good way to win arguments nor to convince people. Now, no matter how qualified your following arguments are, your friend simply wouldn’t listen because you’ve shut his ears off.

    <p>And that’s why the distinction is very important to understand. To persuade people who subscribe to populism, we first need to understand populism. Name-calling doesn’t work. Let’s not forget that Donald Trump won.  </p>
